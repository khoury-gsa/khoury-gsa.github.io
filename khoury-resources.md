### Social Events for Khoury PhD Students

##### Currently active (as of October 2021). See [the calendar](https://khoury-gsa.github.io/calendar.html) for more details

* _Game Nights_ (#game-nights on Slack) are held every other Friday, in the evening. 
They usually involve playing board games
(provided by the college and attendees), but other activities include
movies, visiting the Museum of Fine Arts, etc.
We used to organize dinner but that has not resumed after the pandemic. The host is Kutub Gandhi.

* _Book Club_ (#book-club on Slack) is held every other Wednesday 5 PM and entails reading books and discussing
them. Currently, the focus is on science fiction. The host is Daniel Melcer.

##### Currently defunct (as of October 2021)

* _Social Hours._ Pre-COVID, Social Hour was held every week, in ISEC or WVH. The
college provided a small budget to order food and drinks (e.g., pizza,
doughnuts, bagels, cookies, fruit, coffee, etc.), allowing PhD students across
different labs to take a break, gather, and socialize. (There is currently work on restarting this social hour. Reach out to the kgsa if you are interested in helping)

* _Undistinguished Lecture Series._ An event where a student gives a talk on any
topic they desire, as long as it is not their research. This was typically held
at the beginning of a Game Night. A fun end-of-semester tradition was to play
“slideshow karaoke.”
