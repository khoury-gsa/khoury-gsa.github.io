### Social Events for Khoury PhD Students

##### Active (as of Summer 2022). See [the calendar](https://khoury-gsa.github.io/calendar.html) for more details

* _Social Hours._ Social Hour is held (almost) every week, in ISEC or WVH (usually,
alternates weekly). The college provides a small budget to order food and drinks (e.g., pizza,
doughnuts, bagels, cookies, fruit, coffee, etc.), allowing PhD students across
different labs to take a break, gather, and socialize. Follow #phd-social-hour on Slack to
find out more. The hosts are Andrew Walter and Daniel Melcer.

##### Paused (as of Spring 2022)

* _Book Club_ (#book-club on Slack) is held every other Wednesday 5 PM and entails reading books and discussing
them. Currently, the focus is on science fiction. The host is Daniel Melcer.

* _Game Nights_ (#game-nights on Slack) were held every other Friday, in the evening. 
They usually involved playing board games
(provided by the college and attendees), but other activities include
movies, visiting the Museum of Fine Arts, etc.
We used to organize dinner but that has not resumed after the pandemic. The host is Kutub Gandhi.

* _Undistinguished Lecture Series._ An event where a student gives a talk on any
topic they desire, as long as it is not their research. This was typically held
at the beginning of a Game Night. A fun end-of-semester tradition was to play
“slideshow karaoke.”
