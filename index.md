Khoury Graduate Student Association (KGSA)’s mission is to support and maintain
a community among graduate students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Our intended audience is primarily PhD students in
Khoury College, but Master’s students will also be welcome to participate. Just
like other GSA organizations in other departments, we intend to serve as both a
social space, and as a democratic body that will advocate for the interests of
Khoury graduate students with the college administration.

**Contact us** via [kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com](mailto://kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com) or
the [Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#gsa` channel: we
are always happy to meet new people and hope to get more members!
To get added to the Slack, use the `<NEU‑username>@husky.neu.edu` email.
Learn more [about us](/about.html) and check out [our calendar](./calendar.html) on this website.
