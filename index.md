Khoury Graduate Student Association (KGSA)’s mission is to support and maintain
a community among graduate students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Our intended audience is primarily PhD students in
Khoury College, but Master’s students will also be welcome to participate. Just
like other GSA organizations in other departments, we intend to serve as both a
social space, and as a democratic body that will advocate for the interests of
Khoury graduate students with the college administration.

**Contact us** via [kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com](mailto://kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com) or
the [Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#gsa` channel: we
are always happy to meet new people and hope to get more members!
To get added to the Slack, use the `<NEU‑username>@husky.neu.edu` email.

### First Help

If you have a question regarding the PhD program,
the following resources usually can help:

* Official (maintained by Khoury admins): [Khoury PhD Pragrams page on Canvas][notebook-canvas]

* Older version of the part of the previous: [Academic Catalog → PhD Program Requirements][program-reqs-old]
  (doesn't require login with the NEU account)

* Crowd-sourced by students: [PhD Hub on Confluence][confluence], [a Google Doc][notebook-gdoc],
  [KGSA website wiki][our-wiki]

If the question remains:

* Email the khoury administration: [khoury-graduateprograms@northeastern.edu][khoury-grad-mailbox]
* [Set up a meeting with Laura](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.campus.eab.com%2Fpal%2FWu_BybLIkR&data=04%7C01%7Cgandhi.ku%40northeastern.edu%7C93803896dfd74ccb520108d9a87ed168%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637726084896798159%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Rt4hzAObRIvrqFsXv%2BHzHBa510Ks44dvlrQ7p5mjuv4%3D&reserved=0)

This goes to Laura Adrien, Kellie Melchin and Amal Ahmed. Normally, Laura will take care of it
if she is in the office; otherwise the other admins will take it.
For sensitive or time-critical questions, the admins
suggest pinging Laura and/or Kellie via MS Teams.

To solicit common wisdom, post your question on the 
[Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#everyone` channel.

### Social Events for Khoury PhD Students

##### Currently active (as of October 2021). See [the calendar](https://khoury-gsa.github.io/calendar.html) for more details

* _Game Nights_ (#game-nights on Slack) are held every other Friday, in the evening. 
They usually involve playing board games
(provided by the college and attendees), but other activities include
movies, visiting the Museum of Fine Arts, etc.
We used to organize dinner but that has not resumed after the pandemic. The host is Kutub Gandhi.

* _Book Club_ (#book-club on Slack) is held every other Wednesday 5 PM and entails reading books and discussing
them. Currently, the focus is on science fiction. The host is Daniel Melcer.

##### Currently defunct (as of October 2021)

* _Social Hours._ Pre-COVID, Social Hour was held every week, in ISEC or WVH. The
college provided a small budget to order food and drinks (e.g., pizza,
doughnuts, bagels, cookies, fruit, coffee, etc.), allowing PhD students across
different labs to take a break, gather, and socialize. (There is currently work on restarting this social hour. Reach out to the kgsa if you are interested in helping)

* _Undistinguished Lecture Series._ An event where a student gives a talk on any
topic they desire, as long as it is not their research. This was typically held
at the beginning of a Game Night. A fun end-of-semester tradition was to play
“slideshow karaoke.”
