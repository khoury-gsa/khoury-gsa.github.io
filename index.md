title: Khoury GSA

Khoury Graduate Student Association (KGSA)’s mission is to support and maintain
a community among graduate students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Our intended audience is primarily PhD students in
Khoury College, but Master’s students will also be welcome to participate. Just
like other GSA organizations in other departments, we intend to serve as both a
social space, and as a democratic body that will advocate for the interests of
Khoury graduate students with the college administration.

If you want to lear more about KGSA, check out [this presentation of our agenda][gsa-slides-spring-2021]
from Spring 2021.

### Useful Resources

There are many problems that pop up again and again in front of a Khoury PhD student.
KGSA tries to coordinate a wealth of common knowledged collected by many generations of the students.
We suggest trying the following resources to find answers to your questions:

* [Khoury PhD Pragrams][notebook-canvas] page on Canvas

* [PhD Hub on Confluence][confluence]

* [Crowd-sourced Google Doc][notebook-gdoc]

If you are more of an “ask-around” person, do not hesitate to post to 
[Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#everyone` channel, or shoot an email to
[Sarah Gale][sarah] who has been tremendously helpful for many of us.
