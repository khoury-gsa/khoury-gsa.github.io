title: Khoury GSA

Khoury Graduate Student Association (KGSA)’s mission is to support and maintain
a community among graduate students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Our intended audience is primarily PhD students in
Khoury College, but Master’s students will also be welcome to participate. Just
like other GSA organizations in other departments, we intend to serve as both a
social space, and as a democratic body that will advocate for the interests of
Khoury graduate students with the college administration.

**Contact us** via [kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com](mailto://kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com) or
the [Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#gsa` channel: we
are always happy to meet new people and hope to get more members!
To get added to the Slack, use the `<NEU‑username>@husky.neu.edu` email.

### First Help

If you have a question regarding the PhD program, the following resources usually can help:

* Official (maintained by Khoury admins): [Khoury Resource Center][notebook-sharepoint]

* Older iterations of the previous: 
    * [Academic Catalog → PhD Program Requirements][program-reqs-old]
    * [Khoury PhD Pragrams page on Canvas][notebook-canvas]

* Crowd-sourced by students: [PhD Hub on Confluence][confluence], [a Google Doc][notebook-gdoc],
  [KGSA website wiki][our-wiki]

If the question remains:

* Email the khoury administration: [khoury-graduateprograms@northeastern.edu][khoury-grad-mailbox]
* [Set up a meeting with Laura](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.campus.eab.com%2Fpal%2FWu_BybLIkR&data=04%7C01%7Cgandhi.ku%40northeastern.edu%7C93803896dfd74ccb520108d9a87ed168%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637726084896798159%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Rt4hzAObRIvrqFsXv%2BHzHBa510Ks44dvlrQ7p5mjuv4%3D&reserved=0)

This goes to Laura Adrien, Kellie Melchin and Amal Ahmed. Normally, Laura will take care of it
if she is in the office; otherwise the other admins will take it.
For sensitive or time-critical questions, the admins
suggest pinging Laura and/or Kellie via MS Teams.

To solicit common wisdom, post your question on the 
[Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#everyone` channel.
