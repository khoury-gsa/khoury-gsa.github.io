Khoury Graduate Student Association (KGSA)’s mission is to support and maintain
a community among graduate students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Our intended audience is primarily PhD students in
Khoury College, but Master’s students will also be welcome to participate. Just
like other GSA organizations in other departments, we intend to serve as both a
social space, and as a democratic body that will advocate for the interests of
Khoury graduate students with the college administration.

If you want to learn more about the Khoury GSA, check out [this presentation of our agenda][gsa-slides-summer-2021]
from Spring 2021. You can also read the [short descriptions](#khoury-gsa-activities) of
our activities.

Contact us via [kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com](mailto://kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com) or
say “Hi!” in the [Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#gsa` channel: we
are always happy to meet new people and hope to get more students as active members!
To get added to the Slack, use the `<NEU‑username>@husky.neu.edu` email.

Here is the list of the current active members:

### Useful Resources

There are many problems that pop up again and again in front of a Khoury PhD student.
KGSA tries to coordinate a wealth of common knowledge collected by many generations of the students.
We suggest trying the following resources to find answers to your questions:

* [Khoury PhD Pragrams page on Canvas][notebook-canvas]

* [PhD Hub on Confluence][confluence]

* [Crowd-sourced Google Doc][notebook-gdoc]

Note that the first resource is administered by the College, whereas the other two
are crowd-sourced by the students, so feel free to add any useful information there.

If you are more of an “ask-around” person, do not hesitate to post your question on the 
[Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#everyone` channel, or shoot an email to
[Sarah Gale][sarah] who has been tremendously helpful for many of us.

### Khoury GSA Activities

**Social Events**

* _Social Hours._ Pre-COVID, Social Hour was held every week, in ISEC or WVH. The
college provided a small budget to order food and drinks (e.g., pizza,
doughnuts, bagels, cookies, fruit, coffee, etc.), allowing PhD students across
different labs to take a break, gather, and socialize.

* _Game Nights._ A Game Night is essentially a Social Hour held every other week,
in the evening, with dinner provided. It usually involves playing board games
(provided by the college and attendees), but other proposed activities include
movies, visiting the Museum of Fine Arts, etc. In the COVID era, we have moved
to playing board games over Zoom.

* _Undistinguished Lecture Series._ An event where a student gives a talk on any
topic they desire, as long as it is not their research. This was typically held
at the beginning of a Game Night. A fun end-of-semester tradition was to play
“slideshow karaoke.”

**Representing Khoury PhD students**

* _Meetings with the Khoury admins._ Approximately once a month, we meet with the
administration (currently Sarah Gale, Frank Tip, and Bryan Lackaye) to discuss
student concerns, provide updates, and share news.

* _Town Hall coordination._ Once a semester, the Khoury administration organizes
a PhD Town Hall for students to raise their concerns and ask questions. The GSA
collects student concerns ahead of the Town Hall, debriefs the admin on those
concerns, and helps present these issues at the Town Hall.

* _Monthly GSA meetings._ We meet once a month to coordinate and plan our various
activities and events. These meetings are open to all Khoury PhD students:
anyone can attend and present, or just observe.

* _Other activities._ There are many issues we are working on, or planning to work
on. **We are looking for new GSA members to help us with these activities.**
These include advocating for better equipment and remote work conditions,
improving the Academic Review process, improving the course waiver process, and
more.
