Khoury Graduate Student Association (KGSA)’s mission is to support and maintain
a community among graduate students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Our intended audience is primarily PhD students in
Khoury College, but Master’s students will also be welcome to participate. Just
like other GSA organizations in other departments, we intend to serve as both a
social space, and as a democratic body that will advocate for the interests of
Khoury graduate students with the college administration.

Contact us via [kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com](mailto://kgsa-oc@googlegroups.com) or
say “Hi!” in the [Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#gsa` channel: we
are always happy to meet new people and hope to get more students as active members!
To get added to the Slack, use the `<NEU‑username>@husky.neu.edu` email.

### First Help

There are many problems that pop up again and again in front of a Khoury PhD student.
KGSA tries to coordinate a wealth of common knowledge collected by many generations of the students.
We suggest trying the following resources to find answers to your questions:

* Official (maintained by Khoury admins): [Khoury PhD Pragrams page on Canvas][notebook-canvas]

* Crowd-sourced by students: [PhD Hub on Confluence][confluence], [a Google Doc][notebook-gdoc],
  [KGSA website wiki][our-wiki].

If you are more of an “ask-around” person, do not hesitate to post your question on the 
[Khoury PhDs Slack][khoury-slack] `#everyone` channel, or shoot an email to
the Khoury administration mailbox for graduate students' questions
[khoury-graduateprograms@northeastern.edu][khoury-grad-mailbox].
For sensitive or time-critical questions, the Khoury administration
suggests pinging Laura Adrien and/or Kellie Melchin via MS Teams.

### Social Events for Khoury PhD Students

##### Currently (October 2021) active

* _Game Nights_  are held every other week on Fridays, in the evening. 
It usually involves playing board games
(provided by the college and attendees), but other proposed activities include
movies, visiting the Museum of Fine Arts, etc.
We used to organize dinner but that has not resumed after the pandemic.

##### Currently (October 2021) defunct

* _Social Hours._ Pre-COVID, Social Hour was held every week, in ISEC or WVH. The
college provided a small budget to order food and drinks (e.g., pizza,
doughnuts, bagels, cookies, fruit, coffee, etc.), allowing PhD students across
different labs to take a break, gather, and socialize.

* _Undistinguished Lecture Series._ An event where a student gives a talk on any
topic they desire, as long as it is not their research. This was typically held
at the beginning of a Game Night. A fun end-of-semester tradition was to play
“slideshow karaoke.”

### Representing Khoury PhD students

* _Meetings with the Khoury admins._ Approximately once a month, we meet with the
administration to discuss student concerns, provide updates, and share news.

* _Town Hall coordination._ Once a semester, the Khoury administration organizes
a PhD Town Hall for students to raise their concerns and ask questions. The GSA
collects student concerns ahead of the Town Hall, debriefs the admin on those
concerns, and helps present these issues at the Town Hall.

* _Monthly GSA meetings._ We meet once a month to coordinate and plan our various
activities and events. These meetings are open to all Khoury PhD students:
anyone can attend and present, or just observe.

* _Other activities._ There are many issues we are working on, or planning to work
on. **We are looking for new GSA members to help us with these activities.**
These include advocating for better equipment and remote work conditions,
improving the Academic Review process, improving the course waiver process, and
more.
