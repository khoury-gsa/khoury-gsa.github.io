[this presentation of our agenda][gsa-slides-summer-2021]
from Spring 2021. You can also read the list of our activities below.

#### Representing Khoury PhD students

* _Meetings with the Khoury admins._ We meet with the
administration regularly to discuss student concerns, provide updates, and share news.

* _Town Hall coordination._ Once a semester, the Khoury administration organizes
a PhD Town Hall for students to raise their concerns and ask questions. The GSA
collects student concerns ahead of the Town Hall, debriefs the admin on those
concerns, and helps present these issues at the Town Hall.

* _Monthly GSA meetings._ We meet once a month to coordinate and plan our various
activities and events. These meetings are open to all Khoury PhD students:
anyone can attend and present, or just observe.

* _Other activities._ There are many issues we are working on, or planning to work
on. **We are looking for new GSA members to help us with these activities.**
These include advocating for better equipment and remote work conditions,
improving the Academic Review process, improving the course waiver process, and
more.
