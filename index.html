<p>Khoury Graduate Students Association (KGSA)’s mission is to support and maintain
a community among graduate students in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences 
at Northeastern University. Our intended audience is primarily PhD students 
in Khoury College, but Master’s students will also be welcome to participate. 
Just like other GSA organizations in other departments, we intend to serve 
as both a social space, and as a democratic body that will advocate for the 
interests of Khoury graduate students with the college administration.
